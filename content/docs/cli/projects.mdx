## st init

Create a new Strayl project from the current git repository.

```bash
st init
```

You must be inside a git repository to run this command. It will:
1. Create the project in your Strayl account
2. Add a `strayl` git remote pointing to the new repository
3. Configure git credentials automatically
4. Optionally push your current branch to `dev`

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `[name]` | Project name as a positional argument |
| `--name <name>` | Project name (defaults to current directory name) |
| `--private` | Create as a private project (default: public) |
| `--description <desc>` | Project description |

### Example

```bash
cd my-app
st init --name "My App" --private
```

After creating, you can push your code:

```
Strayl project created: https://app.strayl.dev/alice/my-app

Push current code to dev? [Y/n]
```

## st link

Link an existing local git repository to an existing Strayl project.

```bash
st link username/project
```

Requires `username/project` format. This adds the `strayl` remote and configures git credentials. The remote `dev` branch must be empty — if the project already has code, use `st clone` instead.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force-push` | Force-push local code to dev (use only if dev is empty) |

### Example

```bash
cd my-app
st link alice/my-app
```

After linking, you'll be prompted to push your local code to `dev`.

## st clone

Clone a Strayl repository to a local directory.

```bash
st clone username/repo
```

This is a wrapper around `git clone` that accepts the `username/repo` shorthand instead of a full URL. The `strayl` git credentials are used automatically.

### Example

```bash
st clone alice/my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can also pass a full URL:

```bash
st clone https://api.strayl.dev/alice/my-app.git
```

## st status

Show the current project and pending change proposals.

```bash
st status
```

**Output:**

```
Project: alice/my-app → https://app.strayl.dev/alice/my-app
Branch:  add-dark-mode
Visibility: public

Pending changes (2):
  chg_abc123      Add dark mode toggle                      proposed
  chg_def456      Fix signup validation          ⚠          needs_restack
```

The `⚠` indicator means the change has a conflict with `dev` and needs to be restacked before it can be merged.
