title: Git Workflow
description: Push, pull, and promote changes between local and Strayl sandbox.
---

The Strayl CLI uses a Git-like workflow for syncing code between your local machine and the remote sandbox.

## st push

Push local changes to the Strayl sandbox and trigger a deployment.

```bash
st push
```

This is the primary command you'll use to deploy changes. It:
1. Computes a diff between your local files and the sandbox
2. Uploads the changed files
3. Triggers a build
4. Promotes the build to production (if `--deploy` is set)

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--message <msg>` | Change description (shown in Change history) |
| `--deploy` | Trigger a production deployment after push (default: yes) |
| `--no-deploy` | Push to sandbox only, don't deploy |
| `--env <name>` | Target environment (`production`, `preview`) |
| `--project <id>` | Override the linked project |

### Examples

```bash
# Push and deploy
st push --message "Add dark mode toggle"

# Push without deploying (preview/sandbox only)
st push --no-deploy

# Push to a specific project
st push --project proj_abc123
```

## st pull

Pull the current sandbox state to your local directory.

```bash
st pull
```

This downloads any files the AI agent has modified in the sandbox that aren't reflected locally. Useful when you've been using the web UI and want to continue locally.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force` | Overwrite local changes without prompt |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be pulled without downloading |

### Example

```bash
# See what would be pulled
st pull --dry-run

# Pull all remote changes
st pull
```

## st promote

Promote a specific deployment to production.

```bash
st promote [deployment-id]
```

Without an argument, promotes the most recent successful deployment.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--list` | List available deployments before selecting |

### Example

```bash
# List and interactively select
st promote --list

# Promote a specific deployment
st promote dep_abc123
```

## Typical workflow

Here's a typical development workflow combining local editing and Strayl:

```bash
# 1. Start by pulling the latest sandbox state
st pull

# 2. Make local edits
code .

# 3. Test locally
npm run dev

# 4. Push when ready
st push --message "Fix user signup validation"

# 5. Check deployment
st status
```

## Conflict resolution

If both local and remote have changes (`diverged` status):

```bash
# See what's different
st status

# Pull remote changes (merges into your local)
st pull

# Resolve any conflicts manually, then push
st push
```
