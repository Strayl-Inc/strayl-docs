## st login

Authenticate the CLI with your Strayl account.

```bash
st login
```

This opens your browser to complete OAuth. Once complete, the token is saved to `~/.strayl/config.json`.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--token <token>` | Authenticate with a personal access token (non-interactive) |
| `--browser` | Force browser-based login (default) |

### Token-based login

For CI/CD environments where browser auth isn't possible:

```bash
st login --token <your-personal-access-token>
```

Create personal access tokens in your account settings at [app.strayl.dev](https://app.strayl.dev).

## st logout

Remove stored credentials from the local machine.

```bash
st logout
```

This deletes the token from `~/.strayl/config.json`. Your account and projects are unaffected.

## st whoami

Show the currently authenticated user.

```bash
st whoami
```

**Output:**

```
Authenticated as: alex@example.com (Alex Johnson)
Default project: my-app (proj_abc123)
```

## CI/CD authentication

For automated environments, use environment variables instead of the config file:

```bash
STRAYL_TOKEN=<your-token> st push
```

Or set it permanently in your CI environment variables.

### GitHub Actions example

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Strayl
  env:
    STRAYL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.STRAYL_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    npm install -g @strayl/cli
    st push --project ${{ vars.STRAYL_PROJECT_ID }}
```

## Token expiry

Personal access tokens can be set to expire. The CLI will warn you 7 days before expiry:

```
Warning: Your Strayl token expires in 5 days. Renew it at app.strayl.dev/settings/tokens
```
