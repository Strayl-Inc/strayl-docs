title: Authentication
description: Log in, log out, and manage credentials with the Strayl CLI.
---

## st login

Authenticate the CLI with your Strayl account.

```bash
st login
```

This opens your browser to complete OAuth. A local server starts on `localhost:9876` to receive the callback. Once authentication is complete, credentials are saved to `~/.strayl/credentials`.

If the browser doesn't open automatically, the CLI will print the login URL for you to open manually.

The login session expires after a set period. The CLI will automatically detect an expired token and ask you to log in again.

## st logout

Remove stored credentials from the local machine.

```bash
st logout
```

This deletes the credentials file and removes the Strayl entry from `~/.git-credentials`. Your account and projects are unaffected.

## st whoami

Show the currently authenticated user.

```bash
st whoami
```

**Output:**

```
@alex
alex@example.com
```

## What login sets up

When you log in, the CLI also configures git credentials automatically so you can push to Strayl repositories without entering a password:

```bash
# These are set automatically after st login
git config --global credential.helper store
# credentials written to ~/.git-credentials
```

If you ever need to re-apply this configuration (e.g. after a system change), run:

```bash
st setup-git
```
