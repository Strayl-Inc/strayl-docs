title: CLI Overview
description: Install and configure the Strayl CLI (st) for terminal-based workflows.
---

The **Strayl CLI** (`st`) lets you work with Strayl from your terminal. It is a **Git-based tool** — under the hood it works with a `strayl` git remote added to your local repository. You can push feature branches, create change proposals, manage deployments, and inspect project status without opening the browser.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @strayl/cli
```

Or with other package managers:

```bash
pnpm add -g @strayl/cli
yarn global add @strayl/cli
bun add -g @strayl/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
st --version
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Authenticate
st login

# Create a new Strayl project from an existing git repository
st init

# Or link an existing local repository to a Strayl project
st link username/my-project

# Push a feature branch and create a change proposal
st push

# Pull the latest dev or main branch from Strayl
st pull
```

## Commands reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `st login` | Authenticate with your Strayl account (browser OAuth) |
| `st logout` | Remove stored credentials |
| `st whoami` | Show currently authenticated user |
| `st config` | Show or update CLI configuration |
| `st init [name]` | Create a new Strayl project from this git repository |
| `st link <username/project>` | Link this repository to an existing Strayl project |
| `st clone <username/repo>` | Clone a Strayl repository |
| `st status` | Show project info and pending change proposals |
| `st push [branch]` | Push a feature branch and create a change proposal |
| `st pull [dev\|main]` | Pull the latest dev or main branch from Strayl |
| `st promote` | Promote dev branch to main (deploy to production) |
| `st changes` | List change proposals for this project |
| `st change <id> [action]` | View or act on a change (actions: `approve`, `deny`, `restack`) |
| `st setup-git` | Re-configure git credentials (usually not needed) |

## How the git integration works

After running `st init` or `st link`, the CLI adds a git remote called `strayl` to your repository:

```bash
# This is what happens under the hood
git remote add strayl https://api.strayl.dev/username/project.git
```

From that point on, the standard Strayl workflow is:

```bash
# 1. Work on a feature branch (not main or dev)
git checkout -b my-feature

# 2. Make commits as usual
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# 3. Push the branch and create a change proposal
st push

# 4. Review and approve the change at app.strayl.dev
# 5. When ready to deploy, promote dev → main
st promote
```

## Configuration

The CLI stores configuration in `~/.strayl/config.json` and credentials in `~/.strayl/credentials`.

```bash
# Show current configuration
st config --show

# Override API or app URL (for self-hosted instances)
st config --api-url https://api.example.com
st config --app-url https://app.example.com
```

## Shell completion

Enable tab completion for `st` commands:

```bash
# Bash
st completion bash >> ~/.bashrc

# Zsh
st completion zsh >> ~/.zshrc

# Fish
st completion fish >> ~/.config/fish/completions/st.fish
```
