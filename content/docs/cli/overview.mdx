title: CLI Overview
description: Install and configure the Strayl CLI (st) for terminal-based workflows.
---

The **Strayl CLI** (`st`) lets you work with Strayl from your terminal. You can push and pull code, manage deployments, inspect changes, and run agent tasks — all without opening the browser.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @strayl/cli
```

Or with other package managers:

```bash
pnpm add -g @strayl/cli
yarn global add @strayl/cli
bun add -g @strayl/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
st --version
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Authenticate
st login

# Link a local directory to a Strayl project
st link

# Push local changes
st push

# Pull remote changes
st pull
```

## Commands reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `st login` | Authenticate with your Strayl account |
| `st logout` | Remove stored credentials |
| `st whoami` | Show currently authenticated user |
| `st init` | Create a new Strayl project from a local directory |
| `st link` | Link a local directory to an existing project |
| `st clone <project>` | Clone a Strayl project to a local directory |
| `st status` | Show the current sync status |
| `st push` | Push local changes to the sandbox and deploy |
| `st pull` | Pull remote changes to the local filesystem |
| `st promote` | Promote a specific deployment to production |

## Configuration

The CLI stores configuration in `~/.strayl/config.json`. You can also use environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `STRAYL_TOKEN` | Override the authentication token |
| `STRAYL_PROJECT` | Override the linked project ID |
| `STRAYL_API_URL` | Override the API base URL (for self-hosted) |

## Project-level config

Link a local directory to a project by running `st link` inside it. This creates a `.strayl` file:

```json
{
  "project": "proj_abc123",
  "name": "my-app"
}
```

Commit this file to share the project link with your team.

## Shell completion

Enable tab completion for `st` commands:

```bash
# Bash
st completion bash >> ~/.bashrc

# Zsh
st completion zsh >> ~/.zshrc

# Fish
st completion fish >> ~/.config/fish/completions/st.fish
```
