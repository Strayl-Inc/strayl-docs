This guide takes you from zero to a live web app. No local setup required.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (for project import and authentication)
- That's it

## Steps

<Steps>

### Create an account

Go to [app.strayl.dev](https://app.strayl.dev) and sign in with GitHub. Strayl uses GitHub OAuth — no separate password needed.

### Create a project

From the dashboard, click **New Project**. You have two options:

- **Start from scratch** — Strayl creates an empty Next.js project in a fresh sandbox
- **Import from GitHub** — paste a repo URL and Strayl clones it

### Chat with the AI

Once your project loads, you'll see the **Chat** panel. Type your first request:

```
Create a landing page with a hero section and a signup form
```

The agent will:
1. Enter **Plan Mode** — showing you what it intends to do before writing code
2. Write the code in the sandbox
3. Show you a **Change** with the diff to review

### Review and merge

Click the **Changes** tab to see the diff. Accept the whole change or cherry-pick individual files. When ready, click **Merge**.

### See it live

Your app deploys automatically after merging. Click the deployment URL in the header to see it live.
