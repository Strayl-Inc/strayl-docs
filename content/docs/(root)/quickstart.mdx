This guide takes you from zero to a live web app.

## Prerequisites

- That's it — no local setup needed for the web workflow

## Steps

<Steps>

### Create an account

Go to [app.strayl.dev](https://app.strayl.dev) and sign up with your email, or continue with Google.

### Create a project

From the dashboard, click **New Project**. You have two options:

- **New project** — create a blank project and let the AI scaffold it from scratch
- **Import** — import an existing project from Lovable, Bolt, or v0 by pasting the repository URL

### Chat with the AI

Once your project loads, you'll see the **Chat** tab. Type your first request:

```
Create a landing page with a hero section and a signup form
```

The agent will:
1. Enter **Plan Mode** — showing you what it intends to do before writing any code
2. Write the code on a feature branch
3. Create a **change proposal** with the diff to review

### Review and accept

Go to **Manage → Updates** to see the diff. Review the file changes, then click **Accept** to merge the branch into `dev`.

### Deploy to production

Once you're happy with `dev`, click **Promote** (or run `st promote` from the CLI) to merge `dev` into `main` and deploy your app to a live URL.
