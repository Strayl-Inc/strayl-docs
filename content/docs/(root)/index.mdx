**Strayl** is an AI-powered development platform. You describe what you want to build — Strayl's AI agent writes the code on a git branch, you review the diff, and when you're ready you merge and deploy. Everything is backed by a real git repository — no magic, no lock-in.

## Who is it for?

Strayl is built for developers who want to:

- **Ship faster** — go from idea to production in minutes, not days
- **Focus on product** — let AI handle boilerplate, configuration, and deployment
- **Stay in control** — review every diff before it merges, roll back instantly
- **Work with existing code** — import any GitHub repository and keep building

## How it works

<Steps>

### Describe your feature

Chat with the AI agent in natural language: "Add a user settings page with dark mode toggle." The agent breaks the work into a plan, writes the code on a feature branch, and creates a **change proposal**.

### Review the changes

Open **Manage → Updates** to see the diff. Review it line-by-line, then click **Accept** to merge the branch into `dev`.

### Deploy to production

When you're ready, click **Promote** in the UI or run `st promote` from the CLI. Strayl merges `dev` into `main` and your app goes live.

</Steps>

## Core concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Project** | A git repository hosted on Strayl with an AI agent, deployment pipeline, and database |
| **Chat session** | A conversation with the AI agent — each session works on its own feature branch |
| **Change proposal** | A reviewable diff from a feature branch, proposed to be merged into `dev` |
| **dev / main** | `dev` is the working branch; `main` is production — promoted explicitly |
| **Deployment** | A live version of your app built from `main` |
| **Database** | A Neon Postgres instance provisioned per project |
| **Plan Mode** | Agent planning step where you approve the task before any code is written |
