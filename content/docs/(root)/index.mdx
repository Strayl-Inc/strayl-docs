**Strayl** is an AI-powered development platform. You describe what you want to build — Strayl’s AI agent writes the code, runs it in an isolated sandbox, and deploys it to a live URL. No manual setup. No infrastructure overhead.

## Who is it for?

Strayl is built for developers who want to:

- **Ship faster** — go from idea to production in minutes, not days
- **Focus on product** — let AI handle boilerplate, configuration, and deployment
- **Stay in control** — review every diff, merge selectively, roll back instantly
- **Work with existing code** — import any GitHub repository and keep building

## How it works

<Steps>

### Describe your feature

Chat with the AI agent in natural language: "Add a user settings page with dark mode toggle." The agent breaks the work into a plan and starts coding.

### Review the changes

Every AI action produces a **Change** — a stacked diff you can inspect in the Code View. Review line-by-line, accept selectively, or ask the agent to revise.

### Deploy to production

When you’re happy, click **Merge** (or use `st push` from the CLI). Strayl deploys your changes to a live URL with zero-downtime rollout.

## Core concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Project** | A sandboxed workspace containing your codebase, environment, and deployment |
| **Change** | A stacked diff produced by the AI or a direct edit — the atomic unit of code review |
| **Deployment** | A live version of your app reachable at a public URL |
| **Database** | A Neon Postgres instance provisioned per project with branching support |
| **Plan Mode** | Agent planning step where you approve the task before code is written |
