title: Code View
description: Browse your project's files across branches and understand what the AI agent is working with.
---

The **Code** tab is a file browser that shows the contents of your project's git repository. You can navigate files, inspect their content, and switch between branches.

## Branch switcher

At the top of the Code tab is a **branch switcher** that lets you toggle between:

- **Production** — the `main` branch, what's currently live
- **Dev** — the `dev` branch, what's in progress

When a chat session is active in the sidebar, the Code tab automatically shows the files for that session's feature branch.

## Navigating the file tree

The left sidebar shows your full directory tree. Click any folder to expand it, click any file to open it in the viewer.

The file viewer shows:

- Syntax highlighting for all common languages
- Line numbers
- The exact content of the file on the selected branch

## What you can do in Code View

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Browse files | Click in the directory tree |
| Switch branch | Use the branch switcher at the top of the sidebar |
| Search sessions | Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to open the search dialog |

## Relationship to the repository

The Code view reflects the git repository. Files shown depend on the selected branch. When the AI agent writes files in a chat session, those changes appear in the file tree on the session's branch — not on `dev` until the change proposal is approved.

## Read-only access

The Code view is intentionally read-only. To edit files:

- Ask the agent in Chat
- Use the CLI: clone the repo with `st clone`, edit locally, then `st push` to propose a change

Direct in-browser editing is not supported — all changes go through the review (change proposal) flow.
