description: Browse your project's files and understand what the AI agent is working with.
---

The **Code View** is a read-only file browser that shows the current state of your project's sandbox. Everything the AI agent sees and modifies is visible here.

## Navigating the file tree

The left sidebar shows your full directory tree. Click any folder to expand it, click any file to open it in the viewer.

The file viewer shows:

- Syntax highlighting for all common languages
- Line numbers
- The exact content the agent is working with

## What you can do in Code View

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Browse files | Click in the directory tree |
| Search by filename | Press `Cmd+K` or use the search bar |
| Search file contents | Use the grep search (`Cmd+Shift+F`) |
| Copy a file's content | Click the copy icon in the file header |
| Download a file | Right-click → Download |

## Changes tab

The **Changes** tab within Code View shows all pending and accepted Changes (diffs) in the current session. See [Changes](/docs/platform/changes) for full documentation.

## Viewing active files

When the agent is working, files it's currently reading or writing are highlighted in the tree with a pulsing indicator. This lets you follow along with what the agent is doing in real time.

## Relationship to the sandbox

The Code View reflects the sandbox filesystem exactly. If the agent runs `npm install` and adds files to `node_modules`, those files appear in the tree (though they're filtered out by default with a `.gitignore`-style exclusion).

The sandbox persists between sessions — if you close the browser and come back, the Code View shows the same files.

## Read-only access

The Code View is intentionally read-only. To edit files:

- Ask the agent in Chat
- Use the CLI (`st pull` to sync locally, edit, then `st push`)

Direct editing in the browser is not supported to ensure changes always go through the review (Change) flow.
