description: Create new projects or import existing repositories into Strayl.
---

A **project** in Strayl is a git repository hosted on Strayl, paired with an AI agent, a deployment pipeline, and a database. Each project maps to a single application.

## Creating a project

From the dashboard, click **New Project**. You'll see two options:

### New project

Create a blank project with an empty repository. The AI agent can scaffold your application from scratch — just describe what you want to build in the Chat tab.

### Import from GitHub

Paste a public or private GitHub repository URL. Strayl will clone it into the project's git repository and set up the AI agent context.

## Project settings

After creation, configure your project from **Manage → Settings**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name shown in the dashboard |
| **Visibility** | Public or private repository |

## Deleting a project

Open the project, go to **Manage → Settings**, scroll to the Danger Zone, and click **Delete Project**. This permanently removes the repository, all deployments, and the database. This action cannot be undone.

## Multiple projects

Your account can have multiple projects. The dashboard shows all projects with their:

- Last activity time
- Active deployment URL
- Quick actions (Open, Deploy, Delete)
