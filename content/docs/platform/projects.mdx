description: Create new projects or import existing repositories into Strayl.
---

A **project** in Strayl is a self-contained workspace: a sandboxed codebase, a dev environment, a database, and a set of deployments. Each project maps to a single application.

## Creating a project

From the dashboard, click **New Project**. You'll see two options:

### Start from scratch

Strayl scaffolds a new Next.js application in a fresh sandbox. The scaffold includes:

- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint and Prettier
- A ready-to-run dev server on port 3000

The project is immediately active — the AI agent starts in the Chat panel and you can begin working right away.

### Import from GitHub

Paste a public or private GitHub repository URL. Strayl will:

1. Clone the repository into the sandbox
2. Detect the package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`)
3. Run `install` automatically
4. Start the dev server if a `dev` script is found

For private repositories, you'll need to authorize Strayl to access your GitHub organization during the import flow.

## Project settings

After creation, configure your project from the **Manage** tab:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name shown in the dashboard |
| **Framework** | Detected automatically; affects build commands |
| **Build command** | Override the default (`next build`, `vite build`, etc.) |
| **Install command** | Override the default install command |
| **Output directory** | For static site generators (default: `.next` or `dist`) |

## Deleting a project

Open the project, go to **Manage → Settings**, scroll to the Danger Zone, and click **Delete Project**. This permanently removes the sandbox, all deployments, and the database. This action cannot be undone.

## Multiple projects

Your account can have multiple projects. The dashboard shows all projects with their:

- Last activity time
- Active deployment URL
- Quick actions (Open, Deploy, Delete)
