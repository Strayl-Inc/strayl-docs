title: Team & Roles
description: Invite collaborators and manage access to your Strayl projects.
---

Strayl supports team collaboration on projects. Each member has a role that determines what they can do.

## Roles

There are three roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access: add/remove collaborators, change roles, manage all project settings |
| **Administrator** | Accept/deny change proposals, manage settings, deploy |
| **Developer** | Chat with the AI agent, view code and deployments |

Only the project **owner** can invite collaborators and manage the team.

## Inviting collaborators

The **Add collaborators** button is in the project header (top right area of the project page). Only the owner sees it.

<Steps>

### Open the invite dialog

Click **Add collaborators** in the project header.

### Search for a user

Type a Strayl username or name in the search field. Results appear as you type.

### Select and assign a role

Click a user to add them to the invite list. Each selected user gets the **Developer** role by default — click the role label next to their name to change it to **Administrator**.

### Send the invite

Click **Add collaborator** (or **Add N collaborators** if you selected multiple). The user receives a notification and can accept or decline the invite.

</Steps>

## Accepting an invite

When you're invited to a project, a pending invite appears in your account. You can accept or decline it from the notification or from your dashboard.

## Managing the team

The project owner can:

- **Change a member's role** — click the role badge next to their name in the team popover
- **Remove a member** — use the member menu in the team popover
- **Cancel a pending invite** — open the invite dialog and cancel any unaccepted invite
