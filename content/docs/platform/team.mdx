title: Team & Roles
description: Invite team members and manage access to your Strayl projects.
---

Strayl supports team collaboration on projects. Each team member has a role that determines what they can do.

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access: invite, remove, delete project, manage billing |
| **Admin** | Manage members, configure settings, deploy |
| **Developer** | Chat with AI, accept change proposals, deploy |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to Code View and deployments |

## Inviting members

<Steps>

### Open Team settings

Go to **Manage → Team**.

### Send an invitation

Enter the email address and select a role. Click **Send Invite**.

### Member accepts

The invited person receives an email. They click the link, create an account (or log in), and gain access to the project.

</Steps>

## Managing access

From **Manage → Team**, you can:

- **Change role** — click the role badge next to a member's name
- **Remove member** — click the `···` menu → Remove
- **Cancel a pending invite** — click Cancel next to an unaccepted invitation

## API access tokens

For direct API access, you can create personal access tokens:

1. Go to your account settings (top right → Settings)
2. Click **Access Tokens → New Token**
3. Give it a name and set an expiry
4. Copy the token — it won't be shown again

Use the token as an HTTP header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

## Audit log

Owners and Admins can view the audit log in **Manage → Team → Audit Log**. The log records:

- Who changed what environment variables
- Who triggered which deployments
- Who invited or removed team members
- Who accepted or denied change proposals

## Organization accounts

For larger teams, Strayl supports Organization accounts that group multiple projects under a single billing entity with shared member management.
