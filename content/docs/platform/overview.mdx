description: The Strayl platform — Chat, Code, and Manage in one unified workspace.
---

The Strayl platform is organized around three tabs in the sidebar: **Chat**, **Code**, and **Manage**. Together they give you a complete development environment that runs in the browser, backed by an AI agent and a Git repository.

## The three tabs

### Chat

The Chat tab shows your conversation sessions with the AI agent. Each session corresponds to a git feature branch. You can have multiple sessions (branches) per project and switch between them.

**What you can do in Chat:**

- Request new features ("Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page")
- Ask questions about your codebase ("How does the auth flow work?")
- Debug errors by pasting stack traces
- Request refactors ("Convert these class components to functional")
- Use Plan Mode before significant changes

### Code

The Code tab is a file browser for your project's git repository. A **branch switcher** at the top lets you toggle between the **production** branch (`main`) and the **dev** branch — so you can inspect exactly what's live vs what's in progress.

Click any file to open it in the viewer with syntax highlighting. When a chat session is active, the Code tab shows the files for that session's branch.

### Manage

The Manage tab covers operational concerns. Pages available:

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Releases** | Deployment history, live URLs, build logs |
| **Updates** | Change proposals — review, approve, or deny diffs from feature branches |
| **Analytics** | Traffic and usage metrics |
| **Domains** | Custom domain configuration |
| **Environment** | Environment variables and secrets |
| **Databases** | Neon Postgres connection strings and branches |
| **Logs** | Runtime and build logs |
| **Settings** | Project name, visibility, and other settings |

## How the repository works

Every Strayl project has a git repository hosted at `api.strayl.dev`. It has two core branches:

- **`dev`** — the working branch, updated when the AI agent makes changes or when a change proposal is approved
- **`main`** — the production branch, updated only when you explicitly promote (`st promote` or via the UI)

Feature branches created by the AI agent or via the CLI are proposed as **change proposals** and reviewed in **Manage → Updates** before being merged into `dev`.

## Live preview

While a chat session is active, you can open the **Preview** panel to see your app running. The preview reflects the current state of the agent's working environment for that session — no deployment needed to preview changes.
