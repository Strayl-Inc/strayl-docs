description: How the Strayl AI agent works — models, streaming reasoning, and context.
---

The Strayl AI agent is the core of the platform. It reads your codebase, interprets your instructions, writes code, runs commands, and iterates based on results — all in a continuous loop until the task is complete.

## How the agent works

The agent follows a **ReAct** loop:

1. **Reason** — think about the current task and what needs to be done
2. **Act** — call a tool (write a file, run a command, search the codebase)
3. **Observe** — read the tool output
4. **Repeat** — continue until the task is complete or human input is needed

This loop runs transparently in the Chat panel. You can watch the agent's reasoning stream in real time.

## Streaming reasoning

Strayl streams the agent's thinking as it works. You'll see:

- The agent's step-by-step reasoning before each action
- Tool calls with their inputs and outputs
- A final summary of what was done

This transparency lets you catch mistakes early and course-correct with a follow-up message.

## Context window

The agent maintains context across your entire session. It knows:

- The full directory structure of your project
- The content of files it has read
- The complete conversation history
- Results of previous commands

For large codebases, the agent uses smart context retrieval — searching for relevant files rather than loading everything at once.

## Available tools

The agent has access to the following tools inside the sandbox:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ls` | List directory contents |
| `read` | Read a file |
| `write` | Write or create a file |
| `edit` | Make targeted edits to a file |
| `grep` | Search file contents |
| `glob` | Find files by pattern |
| `exec` | Run any shell command |
| `getLogs` | Read dev server or process logs |
| `showPreview` | Open the live preview in the browser |
| `deleteFile` | Delete a file or directory |
| `moveFile` | Move or rename a file |

## Model selection

You can switch the underlying model from the chat toolbar. Strayl supports multiple frontier models. The default is optimized for coding tasks.

**Tips for getting the best results:**

- Be specific about what you want ("Add a `POST /api/users` endpoint that validates email with Zod") rather than vague ("Add an API")
- If the agent goes in the wrong direction, say "Stop. Revert that and instead..." — the agent understands corrections
- For large refactors, use Plan Mode first to review the approach
- Paste error messages directly — the agent reads stack traces and fixes them

## Interrupting the agent

If the agent is doing something wrong, type a new message to interrupt it. The current tool call will complete, then the agent will read your correction and adjust.
