description: Neon Postgres databases — provisioning, branching, and connection strings.
---

Every Strayl project gets a **Neon Postgres** database. Neon is a serverless Postgres provider with branching support — you can create an isolated copy of your database for the AI to experiment with, then merge or discard it.

## Automatic provisioning

When you create a project, Strayl provisions a Neon database automatically. You don't need to configure anything — the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is available in both the dev environment and your production deployment from day one.

## Accessing the database

### From your app

Use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
});
```

### From the Manage panel

Go to **Manage → Database**. You'll see:

- Connection string (click to reveal)
- A query console for running SQL
- Table explorer
- Branch management

## Database branches

Neon supports **database branches** — isolated copies of your database with their own connection string. Branches let the AI agent run schema migrations safely without touching your production data.

Manage branches from **Manage → Databases** in the web UI.

## Migrations

Strayl supports any migration tool. The agent will use whatever you have set up:

- **Drizzle ORM** — `drizzle-kit push` or `drizzle-kit migrate`
- **Prisma** — `prisma migrate deploy`
- **Raw SQL** — the agent writes SQL files and runs `psql`

## Backups and storage

Neon provides:

- Continuous point-in-time recovery (PITR) up to 30 days
- Automatic backups
- Storage scales automatically — you pay for what you use
