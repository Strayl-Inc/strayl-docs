title: Plan Mode
description: Review and approve the agent's plan before it writes any code.

**Plan Mode** is a step where the AI agent outlines exactly what it intends to do before touching any files. You review the plan and decide whether to proceed, modify, or cancel.

## Why use Plan Mode?

For significant changes — new features, refactors, architectural decisions — it's valuable to see the agent's intent upfront:

- **Catch misunderstandings early** before code is written
- **Understand scope** — know which files will be affected
- **Give feedback** — guide the approach before any work happens
- **Save time** — one correction at the planning stage beats five corrections during execution

## How it works

When you send a message, the agent can enter Plan Mode automatically (based on the complexity of the request) or you can trigger it explicitly.

### Automatic Plan Mode

The agent enters Plan Mode for requests that involve:

- Creating new pages or components
- Setting up new API routes
- Database schema changes
- Significant refactors

### Explicit Plan Mode

You can trigger Plan Mode by using the **Plan** button in the chat toolbar before sending your message.

## The planning step

In Plan Mode, the agent will output a structured plan like:

```
I'll refactor auth to use JWT. Here's my plan:

1. Install `jose` for JWT signing/verification
2. Create `lib/auth/jwt.ts` with sign and verify helpers
3. Update `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` to issue a JWT on success
4. Update `middleware.ts` to verify the JWT on protected routes
5. Remove the `next-auth` session dependency
6. Update environment variables: add JWT_SECRET

Files affected: 6 modified, 1 created, 1 deleted
Estimated changes: ~200 lines
```

## Approving or modifying the plan

After the agent presents its plan, a panel appears in the chat with two options:

1. **Confirm** (press `Enter`) — the agent starts coding immediately
2. **Give feedback** (press `↓`, type your note, press `Enter`) — the agent revises the plan based on your input

You can give feedback as many times as needed before confirming. The plan step doesn't write any code — you're safe to iterate.

To cancel, just send a new message saying "cancel" or describe something different.

## Tips

- Ask for a plan on any change, even small ones — it's free and fast
- Plans can reveal unintended side effects ("Wait, you're removing the refresh token?")
- Approved plans become the agent's working spec — it will stick to them
