description: Stacked diffs — review, accept, and merge AI-generated code changes.

Every action the AI agent takes that modifies files produces a **Change**. A Change is a versioned, reviewable diff that you control before it affects your deployment.

## What is a Change?

A Change is similar to a Git commit, but optimized for AI workflows:

- It contains a diff of every file the agent touched
- It has a description generated by the agent
- It can be accepted, rejected, or partially merged
- Changes stack on top of each other — later changes build on earlier ones

## Viewing Changes

Open the **Changes** tab in the Code panel. You'll see a list of all Changes in the current session, newest at the top:

```
● Change #3 — Add dark mode toggle to settings page (2 files)
● Change #2 — Create settings page with user profile form (4 files)
● Change #1 — Set up Tailwind CSS configuration (3 files)
```

Click any Change to expand it and see the file-by-file diff.

## The diff view

The diff view shows:

- **Added lines** in green
- **Removed lines** in red
- **Unchanged lines** in gray (collapsed by default)
- **File tabs** to switch between files in the Change

You can click on any line to add an inline comment or note for the agent.

## Accepting a Change

To accept a Change and include it in your next deployment:

1. Review the diff
2. Click **Accept Change** — the files are now part of your project
3. The Change moves to the "Accepted" state

Accepted Changes accumulate until you **deploy** (either manually or via `st push` in the CLI).

## Rejecting a Change

If the agent's change isn't what you wanted:

1. Click **Reject** on the Change
2. The agent's files are reverted
3. Write a follow-up message to guide the agent differently

## Partial acceptance

You can accept individual files within a Change:

1. Expand the Change
2. Check/uncheck specific files
3. Click **Accept Selected** — only those files are included

## Stacked Changes

Changes are stacked — Change #3 may depend on files modified by Change #2. If you reject Change #2, Change #3 is automatically rejected too (since its base no longer exists).

This ensures consistency: you can't cherry-pick changes that would leave the code in an inconsistent state.

## Change history

All Changes — accepted, rejected, and pending — are stored in the Change history. You can:

- Browse the full timeline
- Restore a rejected Change
- See which Changes are included in each deployment
