**Updates** (also called change proposals) are the core review mechanism in Strayl. Every time the AI agent finishes a task or you run `st push` from the CLI, a change proposal is created — a reviewable diff of a feature branch against `dev`.

You can find them in **Manage → Updates**.

## What is a change proposal?

A change proposal represents a git feature branch that has been proposed for merging into `dev`. It includes:

- A title and description (auto-generated by the AI or provided by you)
- The diff of every file modified on the branch
- Metadata: which chat session created it, stack position, author, date
- A status: **open**, **accepted**, **denied**, or **needs restack**

## Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Open** | Proposed and waiting for review |
| **Accepted** | Approved — branch merged into `dev` |
| **Denied** | Rejected — branch was not merged |
| **Needs restack** | Has conflicts with `dev` — must be resolved before merging |

## Viewing changes

Open **Manage → Updates**. You'll see a list of all change proposals for the project, newest first.

Each row shows:
- Title and the chat session it came from
- Stack position (order in the queue)
- Time ago
- Status badge (for accepted/denied) or action buttons (for open changes)
- Additions/deletions count

Click any row to open the detail view with the full file-by-file diff.

## The diff view

The detail view shows:

- **Added lines** in green
- **Removed lines** in red
- **Unchanged lines** in gray
- **File sections** that can be collapsed/expanded

Each file is shown in a collapsible block with a header indicating whether it was added, modified, or deleted.

## Approving a change

If you are the project owner or administrator:

1. Open the change in **Manage → Updates**
2. Review the diff
3. Click **Accept** (or press `Enter`) — the feature branch is merged into `dev`

After merging, the change status becomes **Accepted** and `dev` is updated.

<Callout type="info">
A change with **Needs restack** status cannot be accepted until the conflict is resolved. Use `st change <id> restack` from the CLI, or ask the AI agent to rebase the branch.
</Callout>

## Denying a change

1. Open the change or find it in the list
2. Click **Deny** (or press `Backspace`) — the branch is not merged and the status becomes **Denied**

## Stacked changes

Changes have a **stack position** — the order they will be applied onto `dev`. If a change earlier in the stack is modified or denied, later changes may need to be restacked because their base has changed.

The `needs_restack` status can appear for three reasons:

| Reason | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `conflict` | File-level merge conflict with the current `dev` |
| `blocked` | A change earlier in the stack is blocking this one |
| `main_moved` | The `main` branch has moved ahead of this change's base |

## Keyboard shortcuts (in detail view)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Accept change |
| `Backspace` | Deny change |
