Every time you merge Changes, Strayl creates a **Deployment** — a production-ready build of your app with a permanent URL.

## Triggering a deployment

Deployments are triggered by:

1. **Merging Changes** from the UI — click **Deploy** in the Changes panel
2. **Pushing from the CLI** — `st push` merges and deploys in one command
3. **Auto-deploy** — enable auto-deploy to trigger on every accepted Change

## Deployment URLs

Each deployment gets:

- A **permanent URL** — `https://[project-id]-[deployment-id].strayl.app`
- An **alias** — the live URL for the current production deployment: `https://[project-name].strayl.app`

When you deploy, the alias is updated to point to the new deployment. Previous deployments remain accessible at their permanent URLs.

## Custom domains

Connect your own domain to a Strayl project:

<Steps>

### Add your domain

Go to **Manage → Domains** and enter your domain (e.g., `app.yourcompany.com`).

### Configure DNS

Strayl will show you a CNAME record to add to your DNS provider:

```
CNAME  app.yourcompany.com  [your-project].strayl.app
```

### Verify

Once DNS propagates (typically 1–5 minutes), your domain is live with automatic HTTPS.

</Steps>

## Rollback

Every deployment is preserved. To roll back:

1. Go to **Manage → Deployments**
2. Find the deployment you want to restore
3. Click **Promote to Production**

The alias immediately points to the selected deployment. Your code doesn't change — the rollback is instant (just a pointer update).

## Build configuration

Strayl auto-detects your framework and runs the appropriate build command:

| Framework | Build command | Output |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Next.js | `next build` | `.next/` |
| Vite | `vite build` | `dist/` |
| Create React App | `react-scripts build` | `build/` |
| Remix | `remix build` | `build/` |

Override these in **Manage → Settings → Build**.

## Build logs

View build logs in real time in **Manage → Deployments → [deployment] → Logs**. If a build fails, the previous deployment remains active and you'll see the error in the logs.

## Environment-specific deployments

Strayl supports two environments:

- **Production** — the live deployment served at your domain
- **Preview** — the sandbox dev server, accessible at a preview URL

Environment variables can be scoped per environment. See [Environment Variables](/docs/platform/environment-vars).
