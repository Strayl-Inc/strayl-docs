description: Deploy your app to production, configure custom domains, and roll back instantly.

A **deployment** is a production build of your app triggered when you promote `dev` to `main`. Each deployment gets a permanent URL and build logs.

You can find your deployments in **Manage → Releases**.

## Triggering a deployment

Deployments are triggered by promoting `dev` to `main`:

- **From the UI** — use the Promote action in the project
- **From the CLI** — run `st promote`

```bash
st promote
```

## Deployment URLs

Each deployment gets:

- A **permanent URL** tied to that specific build
- An **alias** — the live URL for the current production deployment

When you promote, the alias is updated to point to the new deployment. Previous deployments remain accessible at their permanent URLs.

## Custom domains

Connect your own domain to a Strayl project:

<Steps>

### Add your domain

Go to **Manage → Domains** and enter your domain (e.g., `app.yourcompany.com`).

### Configure DNS

Strayl will show you a CNAME record to add to your DNS provider:

```
CNAME  app.yourcompany.com  [your-project].strayl.app
```

### Verify

Once DNS propagates (typically 1–5 minutes), your domain is live with automatic HTTPS.

</Steps>

## Rollback

Every deployment is preserved. To roll back:

1. Go to **Manage → Releases**
2. Find the deployment you want to restore
3. Click **Promote to Production**

The alias immediately points to the selected deployment — the rollback is instant.

## Build logs

View build logs in **Manage → Releases → [deployment] → Logs**. If a build fails, the previous deployment remains active and the error is shown in the logs.

## Environment-specific variables

Environment variables can be scoped to production or development environments. See [Environment Variables](/docs/platform/environment-vars).
